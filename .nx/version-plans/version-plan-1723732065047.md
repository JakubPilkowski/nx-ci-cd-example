# Version Plan - Patch Bump for Both Applications

This version plan bumps both the main application and second application with patch versions.

## Changes Made

- **@nx-ci-cd-example/nx-ci-cd-example**: Patch version bump for development iteration
- **@nx-ci-cd-example/second-app**: Patch version bump for development iteration

Both applications are being updated to maintain consistency across the monorepo while following independent versioning strategy.

## Impact

This patch bump will:

- Update version numbers in package.json files
- Generate appropriate changelog entries
- Maintain semantic versioning compliance
- Skip publishing (as configured in nx.json)
